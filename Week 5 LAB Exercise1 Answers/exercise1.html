        The threat of hackers and crackers is for real, and is alike for everything for everyone. If the security breach at the 
        Babha Atomic Research Center last year by the hacker group <b>milworm</b> didnâ€™t convince you of their capabilities, 
        then consider this: <b>James Davis aka jdavis_a</b>, a resident of 
        <ul>www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bit/2483</ul> homestead community on the Internet, might just be reading your e-mail in 
        your mailbox right now, or using your account for some benign Internet surfing, or exchanging it with someone else on the 
        Net for more such accounts!<br>
        Surprised? Or scared?

        <i>(a-b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> - 2ab + b<sup>2</sup></i><br>

        Whatever it is, <b>jdevis_4</b> claims in his home page Free VSNL passwords <br>that he has got  exactly 
        108 working passwords (and growing daily), 36 <i>satyam, 31<br> MNTL, 11 WimiNet</i> and 23 online passwords.
